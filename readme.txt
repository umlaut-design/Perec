Sigh. Actually, I never thought there would be someone asking for
these. So anyway, here they are. The hidden part is also still
inside. Makes it much easier to find.

You need BP7 to compile it because of the soundlibs. (Sheesh...)
If it won't compile, you messed it up. It's all your fault.

All code is © ÜD. You may distribute this stuff as long as you
don't modify it. If you rip without credits and our permission,
we'll tore your nuts off.

(Why the hell I'm writing this? Nobody checks this out anyway.)
